# Guidelines for ETL Project

This document contains guidelines, requirements, and suggestions for Project 1.

## Team Effort

Due to the short timeline, teamwork will be crucial to the success of this project! Work closely with your team through all phases of the project to ensure that there are no surprises at the end of the week.

Working in a group enables you to tackle more difficult problems than you'd be able to working alone. In other words, working in a group allows you to **work smart** and **dream big**. Take advantage of it!

## Project Proposal

Before you start writing any code, remember that you only have one week to complete this project. View this project as a typical assignment from work. Imagine a bunch of data came in and you and your team are tasked with migrating it to a production data base.

Take advantage of your Instructor and TA support during office hours and class project work time. They are a valuable resource and can help you stay on track.


## Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.


# FIFA World Cup ETL

# Project Overview:
Based on athlete data from the Olympic games between 1896-2014, we created a  machine learning model to predict who would win a medal in the RIO 2016 Olympic Games. 

We are using Amazon Web Services S3 to host our Olympic athlete's dataset from Kaggle.


# Project Contributors:

* Dharti Patel
* Tanisha Blakely
* Abe Jones

# Tech Stack
* Scikit-Learn library for creating ML model for our prediction.
* Amazon AWS S3 to host our Olympic athlete's dataset from Kaggle.
* Python Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and ploting.
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for creating web page with our visualizations.
* SandDance for visualizing athlete data correlations.
